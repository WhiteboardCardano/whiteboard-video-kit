# Whiteboard Cardano Kit

The **Whiteboard Cardano Kit** is an open‑source resource library providing
visual elements, backgrounds, layouts, and scene components designed for
educational whiteboard‑style videos about the Cardano blockchain.

This kit allows creators, educators, SPOs, and community members to easily
assemble high‑clarity visual explanations of Cardano concepts without needing
advanced design experience.

⚠️ **Important:**  
- This kit provides **only reusable visual resources**.  
- We **do not** provide guidance on video production workflow.  
- **Whiteboard Cardano’s logo and branding are NOT included and may NOT be used.**
